# Steps 2 to 4 of entry 9, over the reals

The argument for one input, with the softmax's denominator cleared, as facts about real numbers;
none mentions networks or checkers.

* `logit_le`: the advantage of an output `j` over the label, weighted by the exponentials of the
  scores, is at most `X (F + R) + Y (F + W)`: `X`, `Y` the weights on the label's positions and on
  the others, `F` the direct and positional paths, `R` the label's path, `W` the worst other
  token's (their `compute_largest_wrong_logit_quadratic`, before the average).
* `ratio_lo`, `ratio_hi`: with the other tokens' score gaps between `a_lo` and `a_hi`, and the
  positions holding the label anywhere among the others, the weights compare with those of the
  arrangements of the sorted positional errors (their `compute_extreme_softmaxed_..._quadratic`):
  `X B_lo ≥ A_lo Y` and `X B_hi ≤ A_hi Y`.
* `endpoint_le`: the cleared test at an endpoint, with the average `avg` of the certificate,
  bounds `A (F + R) + B (F + W)` for every output (their average split, taken at `R_max` and
  `R_min`: sound for every `avg`).
* `combine_lo`, `combine_hi`: from an endpoint to the input, when the slope `R - W` has the right
  sign.
